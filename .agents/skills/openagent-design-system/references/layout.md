## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit:** 8px. Sub-base values (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) are used for tight typographic adjustments; structural layout snaps to 8/12/16/20/24.
- **Tokens:** `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 17px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.xxl}` 48px · `{spacing.section}` 80px.
- **Section vertical padding:** `{spacing.section}` (80px) inside a product tile; tiles stack edge-to-edge with 0 gap (the color change provides the break).
- **Card padding:** `{spacing.lg}` (24px) inside utility grid cards.
- **Button padding:** 8–11px vertical, 15–22px horizontal.
- **Universal rhythm constants:** the 17px body line-height multiplier (~25px line) and 21px tagline size show up on every analyzed page.

### Grid & Container

- **Max content width:** ~980px on text-heavy sections (environment), ~1440px on product grids (store, accessories), full-bleed for product tiles (homepage).
- **Column patterns:** 3 to 5 column utility card grid on store/accessories; 2-column side-by-side tiles on homepage occasional sections; single-column centered stack on product tile heroes.
- **Gutters:** 20–24px between cards in a utility grid.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Apple's whitespace is the product's pedestal. Every tile begins with at least 64px of air above its headline and 48–64px below. Product renders are never crowded; the nearest content to a product image is at least 40px away. The footer is the only area that breaks this — there, Apple goes deliberately dense to make the full information architecture visible at a glance.
