## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time. Reference its YAML key directly (`{component.product-tile-dark}`, `{component.search-input}`).
2. Variants of an existing component (`-active`, `-focus`, `-2`, `-3`) live as separate entries in `components:`.
3. Use `{token.refs}` everywhere — never inline hex.
4. Never document hover. Default and Active/Pressed states only.
5. Display headlines stay SF Pro Display 600 with negative letter-spacing. Body stays SF Pro Text 400 at 17px. The boundary is unbreakable.
6. The single drop-shadow (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22) 3px 5px 30px`) is reserved for product photography only.
7. When in doubt about emphasis: alternate surface (light → dark tile) before adding chrome.

## Known Gaps

- Form validation and error states were not surfaced on the analyzed pages; only the neutral search input is documented.
- The homepage's embedded video/player frame uses `{colors.surface-black}`; interior player controls are not documented (they're a platform widget, not a web-design token).
- Some component imagery is dynamic (rotating product hero) and its specific copy varies per surface — component specs name the structure, not the rotating content.
- Dark-mode counterparts for store and accessories utility cards were not surfaced on the analyzed pages; the system documented is the daytime/light-dominant variant Apple ships by default.
- Atmospheric photography (environment page mountain vista) is a content asset, not a design token; the documented `{component.environment-quote-card}` describes the structural surface only.
- The exact backdrop-filter blur radius on `{component.sub-nav-frosted}` and `{component.floating-sticky-bar}` is platform-dependent; production CSS uses `saturate(180%) blur(20px)` as a typical baseline but the value isn't formalized as a token.

The Chinese application menu labels the Agent entry as “运行”; the English label remains “Agent”.
