# Design Tokens

DESIGN.md may embed design tokens in a structured format. The system that we use to describe design tokens is inspired by the
[Design Token JSON spec](https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/#abstract). Specifically, we adopt the concept of typed token groups (colors, typography, spacing) and the `{path.to.token}` reference syntax for cross-referencing values.

These tokens are easily converted from or to `tokens.json`, Figma variables, and Tailwind theme configs.

Design tokens are embedded as YAML front matter at the beginning of the file. The front matter block must begin with a line containing exactly `---` and end with a line containing exactly `---`. The YAML content between these delimiters is parsed according to the schema defined below.

Example:

```yaml
---
version: alpha
name: Daylight Prestige
colors:
  primary: "#1A1C1E"
  secondary: "#6C7278"
  tertiary: "#B8422E"
typography:
  h1:
    fontFamily: Public Sans
    fontSize: 48px
    fontWeight: 600
    lineHeight: 1.1
    letterSpacing: -0.02em
---
```

## Schema

Below is the schema for the design tokens defined in the front matter:

```yaml
version: <string>          # optional, current version: "alpha"
name: <string>
description: <string>      # optional
colors:
  <token-name>: <Color>
typography:
  <token-name>: <Typography>
rounded:
  <scale-level>: <Dimension>
spacing:
  <scale-level>: <Dimension | number>
components:
  <component-name>:
    <token-name>: <string|token reference>
```

The `<scale-level>` placeholder represents a named level in a sizing or spacing scale. Common level names include `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `full`. Any descriptive string key is valid.

**Color**: A color value is any valid CSS color string. Supported formats include:

* Hex: `#RGB`, `#RGBA`, `#RRGGBB`, `#RRGGBBAA`
* Named colors: `red`, `cornflowerblue`, `transparent`
* Functional: `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, `hwb()`
* Wide-gamut: `oklch()`, `oklab()`, `lch()`, `lab()`
* Mixing: `color-mix(in srgb, ...)`

All color values are internally converted to sRGB for WCAG contrast checking. The original format is preserved for display and export.

Hex notation (`#RRGGBB`) remains the recommended default for simplicity and broad tooling support.

- `fontFamily` (string)
- `fontSize` (Dimension)
- `fontWeight` (number) - A numeric font weight value (e.g., `400`, `700`). In YAML, this may be expressed as either a bare number or a quoted string; both are equivalent.
- `lineHeight` (Dimension | number) - Accepts either a Dimension (e.g., `24px`, `1.5rem`) or a unitless number (e.g., `1.6`). A unitless number represents a multiplier of the element's `fontSize`, which is the recommended CSS practice.
- `letterSpacing` (Dimension)
- `fontFeature` (string) - configures
  [`font-feature-settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/font-feature-settings).
- `fontVariation` (string) - configures
  [`font-variation-settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/font-variation-settings).

**Dimension**: A dimension value is a string with a unit suffix. Valid units are: px, em, rem.

**Token References**: A token reference must be wrapped in curly braces, and contain an object path to another value in the YAML tree. For most token groups, the reference must point to a primitive value (e.g., `colors.primary-60`), not a group (e.g., `colors`). Within the `components` section, references to composite values (e.g., `{typography.label-md}`) are permitted.
