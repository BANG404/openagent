# Sections

Every `DESIGN.md` follows the same structure. Sections can be omitted if they're not relevant to your project, but those present should appear in the sequence listed below. All sections use `<h2>` (`##`) headings. An optional `<h1>` heading may appear for document titling purposes but is not parsed as a section.

### Section Order

1. **Overview** (also: "Brand & Style")
2. **Colors**
3. **Typography**
4. **Layout** (also: "Layout & Spacing")
5. **Elevation & Depth** (also: "Elevation")
6. **Shapes**
7. **Components**
8. **Do's and Don'ts**

### Prose and Tokens

## Overview

Also known as "Brand & Style".

This section is a holistic description of a product's look and feel. It defines the brand personality, target audience, and the emotional response the UI should evoke, such as whether it should feel playful or professional, dense or spacious. It serves as foundational context for guiding the agent's high-level stylistic decisions when a specific rule or token isn't explicitly defined.

## Colors

This section defines the color palettes for the design system.

At least the `primary` color palette must be defined, and additional color palettes may be defined as needed.

When there are multiple color palettes, the design system may assign a semantic role for each palette. A common convention is to name the palettes in this order: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, and `neutral`.

Example:

```markdown
## Colors

The palette is rooted in high-contrast neutrals and a single, evocative accent color.

- **Primary (#1A1C1E):** A deep ink used for headlines and core text to provide
  maximum readability and a sense of permanence.
- **Secondary (#6C7278):** A sophisticated slate used primarily for utilitarian
  elements like borders, captions, and metadata.
- **Tertiary (#B8422E):** A vibrant earthy red as the sole driver for
  interaction, used exclusively for primary actions and critical highlights.
- **Neutral (#F7F5F2):** A warm limestone that serves as the foundation for all
  pages, providing a softer, more organic feel than pure white.
```

### Design Tokens

The `colors` section defines all color design tokens. The color tokens should be derived from the key color palettes defined in the markdown prose. The exact mapping from color palettes to color tokens may follow any consistent naming convention.

It is a
map\<string, Color>, that maps the name of the color token to its value.

```yaml
colors:
  primary: "#1A1C1E"
  secondary: "#6C7278"
  tertiary: "#B8422E"
  neutral: "#F7F5F2"
```

## Typography

This section defines typography levels.

Most design systems have 9 - 15 typography levels. The design system may prescribe a role for each typography level.

A common naming convention for typography levels is to use semantic categories such as `headline`, `display`, `body`, `label`, `caption`. Each category may further be divided into different sizes, such as `small`, `medium`, and `large`.

Example:

```markdown
## Typography

The typography strategy leverages two distinct weights of **Public Sans** for
the narrative and **Space Grotesk** for technical data.

- **Headlines:** Set in Public Sans Semi-Bold to establish an institutional
  and trustworthy voice.
- **Body:** Public Sans Regular at 16px ensures contemporary professionalism
  and long-form readability.
- **Labels:** Space Grotesk is used for all technical data, timestamps, and
  metadata. Its geometric construction evokes the precision of a digital
  stopwatch. Labels are strictly uppercase with generous letter spacing.
```

### Design Tokens

The `typography` section defines the precise font properties for the typography design tokens.

It is a
map\<string, Typography>

```yaml
typography:
  h1:
    fontFamily: Public Sans
    fontSize: 48px
    fontWeight: 600
    lineHeight: 1.1
    letterSpacing: -0.02em
  body-md:
    fontFamily: Public Sans
    fontSize: 16px
    fontWeight: 400
    lineHeight: 1.6
  label-caps:
    fontFamily: Space Grotesk
    fontSize: 12px
    fontWeight: 500
    lineHeight: 1
    letterSpacing: 0.1em
```
